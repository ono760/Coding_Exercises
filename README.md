# coding_exercises
A repository with my solutions to some coding exercises in JavaScript. Some of the exercises contain more than one possible solution. Also, some of the files are just an explanation of some JavaScript methods (e.g. forEach, indexOf, etc.,). Repo has been updated to include solutions to the some of the coding exercises using Python.
